# Python_Project

## Project 1: Block Letters

#### Instructions:

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters

Note: This is one of the projects I have completed on Codecademy.

## Project 2: Receipt for Lovely_Loveseats

Store the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. 
Then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.


## Project 3: Weight Calculator

Write a space.py program that helps Codey keep track of their target weight by:

Checks which number planet is equal to.
It should then compute their weight on the destination planet.
Here is the table of conversions:

### Planet	Relative Gravity:

1	Venus	0.91
2	Mars	0.38
3	Jupiter	2.34
4	Saturn	1.06
5	Uranus	0.92
6	Neptune	1.19

## Project 4: Magic 8-Ball

### Instruction:

    Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question 
    with a different fortune each time it executes.

    Use:  the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

        Yes - definitely
        It is decidedly so
        Without a doubt
        Reply hazy, try again
        Ask again later
        Better not tell you now
        My sources say no
        Outlook not so good
        Very doubtful
        
## Project 5: 

### Instruction:
    Build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way 
    to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

    Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

    Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
    Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
    Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight 
    is triple the rate of ground shipping.

## Project 6: Gradebook

### Instruction:

You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. 
Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.
